## Act II Content Plan

### Recruitment Goals
**Target Guild Size**: 12 total members (player + Quintus + 10 recruits)

**Recruitment Sources**:
1. **Exploration Recruits** (3-5 total):
   - Imperial Quarry area (east of highway)
   - Ancient Ruins area (west of highway)
   - Steppes region (northern grasslands)
   - Marshlands region (eastern wetlands)
   - Some could be optional/hidden

2. **Guild Quest Recruits** (remaining slots to reach 10):
   - Obtained through completing guild quests
   - Missions from Quintus's intelligence network
   - Ties recruitment to ongoing cult investigation

### New Systems
- **Recall Command**: Teleport to guild hall common area (implemented)
- **Portal Room**: Unlocks late Act II for fast travel
- **Guild Upgrades**: Building out the guild hall
- **Alliance System**: Forming alliances with factions

## Thematic Elements & Symbolism

### The Number 12 (Order & Creation)
**Symbolism**: Building blocks, stability, completion, creation
- **12 Guild Members**: Matches original guild's peak and founding membership
- **12 Edges of a Cube**: Represents building blocks, structure, creation
- **Connection to Creation Gods**: Antithesis of the entropy god
- **Future Content**: Puzzles and figures relating to creation gods and geometric symbolism

**Why 12 is Significant**:
- Represents the guild at its strongest
- Echoes the original guild that was destroyed
- Cube/building block imagery connects to themes of order and construction
- Creates narrative symmetry with the Five Seals (destruction) vs Twelve (creation)

### The Number 5 (Entropy & Destruction)
**Symbolism**: Chaos, dissolution, unmaking, entropy
- **The Five Seals**: Primordial bindings keeping chaos entities locked away
- **The Unbound Cult**: Seeks to break all five seals and unleash entropy
- **Cascade Failure**: If one seal breaks, all five unravel within days
- **Geometry**: Unknown (5 doesn't map to cube edges like 12 does)

**Why 5 is Significant**:
- Represents the cult's apocalyptic goal
- Ancient binding magic from pre-imperial era
- Maintained through ritual and collective belief
- Cracking first seal during assassination created massive fear/chaos energy

### Order vs. Entropy Theme
**Central Conflict**: Creation/building (player's guild) vs. dissolution/unmaking (The Unbound)
- Player rebuilds guild (order) while cult seeks to unmake reality (entropy)
- Twelve members represent completion and stability
- Five seals represent fragile barriers against chaos
- Geometric puzzles may feature prominently in later content

## Mythology & Lore

### The Five Seals
**Origin**: Age before the Empire
**Created By**: Five heroes who bound primordial entities that fed on chaos and fear
**Nature**: Not physical objects - they are anchors of order maintained through ritual and collective belief
**Entities Bound**: Unknown primordial beings associated with madness, entropy, dissolution of natural law
**Consequence of Failure**: Complete cascade unraveling, end of reality itself

### The Unbound (Ordo Dissolutus)
**Philosophy**: Entropy, decay, unmaking, dissolution of order
**Goal**: Break all Five Seals to unleash primordial chaos
**Methods**:
- Creating maximum fear and chaos to crack seals
- Infiltrating imperial government and military
- Assassination of key figures
- Philosophical recruitment (not gore-focused)
**Current Status**: First seal cracked during Emperor Certius's assassination; cult moving openly

### Keius (God of Light)
**Domains**: Light, knowledge, truth
**High Priestess**: Caelia
**Role**: Keius's priesthood maintains knowledge of the Seals and ancient lore

### Creation Gods (Future Content)
**Connection**: Opposed to entropy/dead gods
**Symbolism**: Building blocks, cubes, geometric order
**Number**: Twelve (edges of cube)
**Planned Content**: Puzzles and challenges related to creation god mythology

## Notes & Reminders

### Design Philosophy
- Keep cult threat philosophical, not gore-focused
- Emphasize entropy/dissolution themes
- Order (player) vs. chaos (cult) central conflict
- Geometric symbolism should feel meaningful

### Pacing Considerations
- Act II should feel expansive but focused
- Recruitment tied to exploration and quests
- Allow player choice in recruit order
- Balance main story with optional content

### Story Questions to Resolve
- How does the number 5 relate to geometry/edges? (Currently unclear)
- Which creation gods are relevant to the story?
- How deeply do the ancient ruins connect to the Seals?
- What is Quintus's connection to the original guild?
- Will any seals actually break, or is prevention the focus?
