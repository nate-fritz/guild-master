Legionnaire,Shield Bash,1,3,1d4+2,4.5,Single,Melee,Stuns target for 1 turn,None,GOOD: Strong opener. Stun is valuable CC. Low damage but utility justifies cost.
Legionnaire,Cleave,2,3,1d4+1,3.5,AOE,Melee,Hits up to 3 enemies,None,DECENT: Situational. Good in multi-enemy fights but weaker than Shield Bash in 1v1.
Legionnaire,Battle Cry,3,2,N/A,N/A,Buff,Self,Taunts all enemies for 2 turns + 50% max EP,5 turns,EXCELLENT: Core tanking tool. Cheap EP cost. Forces aggro and generates resources.

Legionnaire,Shield Wall,10,0,N/A,N/A,Buff,Party,+Defense for 3 turns. Cannot attack during.,10 turns,SITUATIONAL: Free but prevents attacking. Needs testing - might be too restrictive.
Legionnaire,Devastating Slam,15,5,1d6+3,6.5,AOE,Melee,Can stun multiple enemies,None,GOOD: AOE with stun potential. High EP cost but multi-target CC is valuable.
Legionnaire,Whirlwind,20,24,2d10+0,11,AOE,Melee,Hits all enemies ignoring row,None,ULTIMATE: Massive AOE damage. ~90% of max EP. Worthy capstone ability.

Venator,Covering Shot,3,0,1d3+0,2,Single,Ranged,Restores 2 EP (net +2 EP),None,INTERESTING: Free damage + EP generation. Weak damage but enables ability spam.
Venator,Evasive Fire,4,0,1d6+1,4.5,Buff,Self,Dodge next attack + counter volley,10 turns,GOOD: Free defensive option. Counter-attack makes it better than pure dodge.
Venator,Barbed Arrow,5,3,1d4+2,4.5,Single,Ranged,Applies Bleed DOT,None,DECENT: Similar to Rending Strike but ranged. DOT adds value over time.
Venator,Frost Arrow,15,4,1d6+3,6.5,Single,Ranged,Weakens enemy attacks (Ice type),None,VERY GOOD: Damage + debuff. Good defensive option for ranged DPS.
Venator,Thunder Volley,20,6,1d8+2,6.5,AOE,Ranged,Can stun all enemies,None,EXCELLENT: AOE with stun. Lower cost than Whirlwind. Ranged safety is huge.
Oracle,Heal,1,3,2d4+2,7,Heal,Ranged,Restores HP to ally,None,CORE ABILITY: Only healing in early game. Avg 7 HP is okay but might need buff.
Oracle,Lightning Bolt,2,4,1d8+1,5.5,Single,Ranged,Magical damage - ignores armor,None,EXCELLENT: Bypasses defense entirely. Oracle's best damage option early.
Oracle,Blessing,3,5,N/A,N/A,Buff,Party,+2 attack to all party for 4 turns,None,WORKING BUT EXPENSIVE: Confirmed functional. 5 EP is steep - needs 4+ turns to pay off.
Oracle,Flame Strike,5,4,1d6+2,5.5,Single,Ranged,Applies Fire DOT,None,GOOD: Damage + burn. Comparable to Lightning but adds DOT pressure.
Oracle,Barrier,10,0,15 absorb,N/A,Buff,Self,Absorbs 15 damage + heals 10% of blocked,10 turns,EXCELLENT: Free 15 HP shield. Life-saver for fragile Oracle. Essential survival tool.

Oracle,Divine Wrath,15,6,2d6+4,11,Single,Ranged,Holy fire - massive damage,None,EXCELLENT: Highest single-target burst in Oracle kit. Big finisher.
Oracle,Venom,20,3,0d0+0,0,Single,Ranged,Strong Poison DOT (no upfront damage),None,NICHE: Pure DOT. Needs analysis - how much poison damage per turn?

- Level 11-14: NO class gets abilities. Another drought.
- Level 16-19: NO class gets abilities. Another drought.
- Legionnaire: Gets abilities at 1-2-3-5-10-10-15-20-20 (two at 10 and 20)

- Oracle: Gets abilities at 1-2-3-5-10-15-15-20 (two at 15)

Level 3: Battle Cry, Covering Shot, Blessing (3 abilities)
Level 4: Evasive Fire (1 ability - Venator only)

BALANCE CONCERNS:
1. Oracle's Heal might be underpowered (2d4+2 = 4-10 avg 7). Consider 2d4+3 or 2d4+4.
2. Blessing is expensive (5 EP) and slow payoff. Consider 4 EP or increase buff to +3 attack.
3. Shield Wall prevents attacking - very restrictive. Might be trap option.
4. Venom needs clarification - how much poison damage does it deal per turn?
5. Huge level gaps mean players go many levels without new options.
6. Early game (1-4) is thin - only 10 total abilities for 3 classes.

AUTOCOMBAT AI CONCERNS (as mentioned by user):
- Blessing is filtered out (line 1771) - AI won't use it
- Heal is filtered out - AI won't heal allies
- Barrier is filtered out - AI won't shield allies
- Autocombat will be significantly weaker if it can't use support abilities
- New CC/support abilities will widen gap further unless AI is updated

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW ABILITIES:
1. Fill level gaps: 4, 6-9, 11-14, 16-19
2. Add utility options: More CC (roots/slows), dispels, resource manipulation
3. Consider class identity:
   - Legionnaire: Protection, CC, team buffs
   - Venator: Multi-target, mobility, resource efficiency
   - Oracle: Healing, debuffs, magical damage
4. Early game expansion (levels 1-5) - give players more tactical choices
5. Consider adding some "free" (0 EP) abilities to increase action variety
